## ♿ Accessibility

The Herta Theme is designed with accessibility in mind. All themes are validated for WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) compliance:

### Contrast Ratios

- **Primary Text**: Meets WCAG AA Normal (4.5:1) for optimal readability
- **Secondary Text**: Minimum 2.5:1 for less critical information
- **UI Accents**: Minimum 1.95:1 for large UI elements (status bars, buttons, etc.)

### Validation

The build process automatically validates contrast ratios for all color combinations to ensure accessibility standards are met. This validation runs during:

- Theme generation (`npm run build`)
- CI/CD pipeline checks
- Pre-commit validation

All four theme variants (Dark, Light, Pastel Dark, Pastel Light) are tested to ensure they meet these accessibility requirements.

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

**Semantic Color System**: Colors are named by purpose, not appearance, making maintenance and consistency easier.

**Herta's Aesthetic**:

- Purple represents Herta's primary color and genius-level intellect
- Cyan captures the holographic, futuristic technology she creates
- Magenta adds the playful "Kururin" element from her personality

**Readability First**: All color combinations meet or exceed WCAG contrast requirements for optimal code readability.

**Comprehensive Coverage**: Beyond basic syntax highlighting, the theme covers:

- Workbench UI (sidebar, activity bar, status bar)
- Terminal colors
- Git decorations
- Error/warning indicators
- Jupyter Notebook cells
- Extension integrations (Rainbow CSV)
